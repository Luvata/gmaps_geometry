# Google geometry routing

AFAIK, Google maps doesn't contain geometry on routing response, so I use some tricks to get it

It's not an elegant way to get geometry polyline such as google map api, but it's free :D

If you have better solutions (not as clunky as my current approach), please tell me or open a pull request !
